<Meta of={meta} />

The visibility of the button can be controlled by passing to the component a class which defines a responsive rule.  
You can do that by passing the class as a prop to the component.  
For instance, you can pass the class \`desktop-hidden\`, defined in the \`global.css\` file, to hide the button on desktop:

```css
.desktop-hidden {
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
    display: none;
    }
}
```

```html
<AiSearchQueriesOffcanvasShowButton class="desktop-hidden"/>
```
