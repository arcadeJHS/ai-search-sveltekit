import { Canvas, Meta, Story, DocsPage } from '@storybook/blocks';
import meta from './stg-ai-search-app-shell.stories.js';

<Meta of={meta} />

The "app shell" is the core of the "application".  
This component is hence REQUIRED for the application to work.

Mainly, it takes care of the following:

- init the search store, by setting the API's ```baseUrl```
- init i18n, by loading thr dictionaries, and setting the locale language
- create the ```session``` of the underlying LLM API (calling the ```start``` method)
- setup Boostrap and Sveltestrap styles

On page, you simply use it like this:

```html
<stg-ai-search-app-shell
    base-url="http://localhost:8099"
    language="en">
</stg-ai-search-app-shell>
```

<DocsPage />
